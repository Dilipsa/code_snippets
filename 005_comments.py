Comments
#===========================================
Comments in Python are the lines in the code that are ignored by the interpreter 
during the execution of the program.

There are three types of comments in Python:
#===========================================

Single line Comments
# I am single line comment  because I am in single line

multi line Comments
# I am multi line comment  because 
# I am in multiple line
  
Docstring Comments
''' Multi-line comment used 
'''

Why are Comments Used in Python?

  Enhance code readability
  Explaining code to other
  Understanding code if studied after some time
  Documenting the steps and needs for a function
  Sharing code with fellow developers
  Collaborating with multiple people.
