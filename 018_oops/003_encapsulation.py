Encapsulation
=======================================================================================================
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and refers to 
the bundling of data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or procedures) that operate on 
that data into a single unit, called a class. Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object from 
direct access by the outside world and only exposes a public interface through which other parts of the 
program can interact with the object.
