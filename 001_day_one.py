Programming Language:
#======================
Programming language is a set of instructions to create communication human
computer

Python
#======================
Python is a
    high level,        => It is easy to read and understand, looks like English or Mathematics
    intrepreted,       => Executes codes line by line on the fly
    dynamically typed, => No need to define data types, Python understands itself
    object oriented supporting,   => Programming technique based on classes and objects
    general purpose,   => It can be used in web development, scripting, AI/ML an scientific calculation
    programming language.
    
Basic Data types in python
===========================
1] int:
    example:
        number = 100, marks = 679 
2] str:
    Three ways to create string data in python
    using single quote:
        Example:
            name = 'Dilip Sapkota'
    using double quote:
        Example:
            designation = "Django developer"
    using triple quote:
        Example:
            info = '''My name is Dilip Sapkota. I am working in industry from eighteen years'''

3] list:
    creating list
    Example:
    numbers = []            =>created empty list using square bracket
    numbers = list()        => Created empty list using list() class
    marks = [84, 60, 33,90] =>Create list with values
    tuple_info = tuple("My name is Dilip Sapkota.") => creates a list considering all character in string as single element 


4] tuple:
    Creating tuple:
    Example:
    tup_numbers = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
    empty_tuple = tuple()   => Creates an empty tuple using tuple()
    empty_tuple = ()      => creating an empty tuple using `()`
    marks = 100, 89, 87, 78 => Creating tuple without parenthesis
    tuple_single_element = (100,) =>creting a tuple with single element,comma is mandetory for single element otherwise it will be int
    tuple_single_element = 100,   => Creating a single element tuple without parenthesis
    tuple_info = tuple("My name is Dilip Sapkota.") => creates a tuple considering all character in string as single element
    tuple_one = 1,2,3,4
    tuple_two = "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight"
    ocombined_tuple = (tuple_one,tuple_two)     => gives : ((1, 2, 3, 4), ('Five', 'Six', 'Seven', 'Eight'))
    list_to_tuple = tuple([1,2,3,4,5,6,7])      => gives : (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
    

5] set:

6] dict:

7] bool:

8] None:
